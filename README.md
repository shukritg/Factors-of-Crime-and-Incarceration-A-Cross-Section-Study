# Factors-of-Crime-and-Incarceration-A-Cross-Section-Study
Independent Project: Revised from Applied Statistics and Econometrics course Project at NYU (Fall 2017)

This paper investigates potential correlates of state level incarceration and crime rates using cross-sectional 
data on 50 U.S. states in 2014. Despite including several variables that have been traditionally
argued to influence both crime and incarceration, we find only public health to be the most significant
variable in determining state-level incarceration. Under the suspicion of possible endogeneity, the effects of
both violent crime and health are further examined using an instrumental variable approach. The results
of our 2SLS regressions infer that violent crime rates do not significantly explain incarceration, but may
do so through the effect of the quality of public health. In order to develop a comprehensive idea of the
factors affecting crime, we also examine which factors show strong association with property crime rates. We
conclude with policy recommendations that aim to better inform forward-looking state policies in reducing
both crime and incarceration.
